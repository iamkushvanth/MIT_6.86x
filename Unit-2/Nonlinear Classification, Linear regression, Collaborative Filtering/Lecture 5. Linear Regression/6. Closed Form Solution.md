# Necessary and Sufficient Condition for a Solution

In the above video lecture, we verified the following result:

Computing the gradient of

**R_ n(\theta ) = 1/n \sum _{t=1}^{n} \frac{(y^{(t)} - \theta \cdot x^{(t)})^2}{2},**

we get

**\nabla R_ n(\theta ) = A\theta - b (=0) \quad \text {where } \,  A = 1/n \sum _{t=1}^{n} x^{(t)} ( x^{(t)})^ T,\,  b = 1/n \sum _{t=1}^{n} y^{(t)} x^{(t)}.**

Now, which of the following conditions is necessary and sufficient to ensure that **A./theta - b = 0** has a unique solution?

[ ] None of A's entries is 0.

[*] A is invertible.

[ ] A 's dimension is the same as that of /theta's

**Ans:** A is invertible

**Solution:**

For any square matrix **A**, **A/theta - b = 0** has a unique solution **/theta = A^(-1).b**  if and only if **A** is invertible.
