# Nonlinear Classification

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

1. Derive non-linear classifiers from feature maps

2. Move from coordinate parameterization to weighting examples

3. Compute kernel functions induced from feature maps

4. Use kernel perceptron, kernel linear regression

5. Understand the properties of kernel functions
