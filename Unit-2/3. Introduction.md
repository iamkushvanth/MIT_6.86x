# **Introduction Exercise**

Which of the following is true about linear regression? Choose all those apply.

**Solution:**
The observed value, **y** , is a real number. i.e. **y \in \mathbb {R}**
The predictor **f** is a linear function of the feature vectors. i.e. **f(x) = \sum _{i=1}^{d} \theta _ i x_ i +\theta _0** 

**Explantion:**
By definition, in regression, the observed value **y**  is a real number(continuous), unlike **y**  is discrete in classification. The predictor **f** , which tries to emulate/predict **y**  is defined as **f(x) = \sum _{i=1}^{d} \theta _ i x_ i +\theta _0**  .
